consider removing precise float math, if intigers can be divided
(ask copilot)

for awake neurons, instead of making task threads, maybe make a vector of active neurons.
Add an neuron to that list when awake, that list can cycle though all wakeful neurons in a tick.
Neurons when going to sleep will remove themselves from the vector.
Maybe even make two more vectors of neurons to wake, neurons to put to sleep.
between ticks, compare the list first, if a neuron is in both lists, leave it awake.
otherwise, add neurons in the wake list to the awake list,
then remove neurons in the sleep list from the awake list.
then perform the next tick (running all neurons).
should limit active task threads. might be slower on some powerful systems, may not matter.
