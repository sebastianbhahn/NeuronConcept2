doesn't depreciate older todo

add back in same-time neuron firing tracking
maybe have a seperate interval specific function to create new neurons.
new neurons between two other neurons should start with a 0.10 strength maybe? idk.

//-------------------------

since feedback can feasibly run concurrently,
have reward neuron have 3 modes.

enum class RewardMode {training, slowAuto, fastAuto}

RewardMode mode = RewardMode::training; //(default setting)

training: just a count, gets a scaled boost every training input depending on (capped) number of directionally accurate fires. (reset count after)
slowAuto: send 1 directional reward point based on the average of 100 neuron fires, after 100 neuron fires. (not scaled)
fastAuto: send 1 directional reward point based on the average of 10 neuron fires, after 10 neuron fires. (not scaled)
